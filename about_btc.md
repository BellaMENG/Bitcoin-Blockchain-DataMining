## Purely Bitcoin
#### What is a Satoshi?
It is equivalent to 0.00000001 BTC and is currently the smallest transaction unit of Bitcoin.

#### What are the nodes in the Bitcoin P2P network?
According to my understanding, there are two kinds of rows: miners and participants who just want to make transactions. For miners, they listen to and collect broadcasts of transactions, so they can calculate (actually try out) the nonce. For people who just want to make transactions, they just listen to and collect the next computed chain. All the nodes are supposed to keep their own copy of the ledger.

#### What is the order of transactions appearing in blocks? Is it by timestamp of each transaction?

#### What about the process of broadcasting? What is the delay and how do information spread in this P2P network?

#### As a decentralized system, how to make sure this whole process is synchronized?

#### How do miners choose transactions to include? How do they refuse to include transactions with not enough transaction fee?

#### Do mining award and transaction fees go to the same address who found the nonce first?

#### How does the protocol of trying nonces and broadcasting results look like? Do people implement their own versions?


## External information
#### With the concept of mining pool, exactly which address does the mining award and all the transaction fees go to?
